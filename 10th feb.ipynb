    "In Python, the built-in open() function is used to open a file. This function takes in two parameters: the filename, and the mode in which the file should be opened.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the different modes in which a file can be opened using open() function:\n",
    "\n",
    "'r' (read-only mode): This mode is used for reading the contents of a file. The file pointer is positioned at the beginning of the file, and if the file does not exist, a FileNotFoundError is raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "'w' (write mode): This mode is used for writing to a file. If the file exists, its contents are truncated and replaced with the new data. If the file does not exist, a new file is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "'a' (append mode): This mode is used for appending data to an existing file. The file pointer is positioned at the end of the file. If the file does not exist, a new file is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "'x' (exclusive creation mode): This mode is used to create a new file, but only if it does not already exist. If the file exists, a FileExistsError is raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "'b' (binary mode): This mode is used for working with binary files.\n",
    "\n",
    "'t' (text mode): This mode is used for working with text files.\n",

    "#  Q2. Why close() function is used? Why is it important to close a file?\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the close() function is used to close an open file. It is important to close a file after reading from it or writing to it because it frees up system resources that were being used to keep the file open. When a file is opened, the operating system allocates certain resources, such as memory and I/O buffers, to handle the file operations. If the file is not closed properly, these resources may remain tied up, which can cause problems like memory leaks and other system errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The close() function is used to release these resources, which ensures that the file is properly saved and that any data that was written to it is fully processed. Additionally, if you try to open a file that is already open, you may encounter errors or data corruption. Therefore, it is important to close the file after using it, to avoid any potential issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also worth noting that some file systems have a limit on the number of files that can be opened at once. If too many files are left open, this can lead to performance issues or even crashes. By closing files when they are no longer needed, you can avoid these problems and ensure that your code runs smoothly."
